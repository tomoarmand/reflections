- Didn't sleep well on Monday night due to foolishly using phone upon waking in the middle of the night.

- Tired on Tuesday.  Started learning about objects.  Sylvia talked me through running loops on paper.

- Wednesday was good.  Learned more about objects.  Started working on a Guess-the-Number game.

- Thursday was great.  Full marks plus bonus points on the review.  Recapped some of the week's exercises.  Started losing focus at around 3pm.

- Overall it was a good week.  Thought I would have trouble recalling information during the review, but that was not the case.  Practise makes permanent.  The extra work in the weekend appears to be paying off.  Be careful not to burn out.  Try different methods of study.
