- Daily mindfulness exercise.

- Wifi was down for a couple of hours.

- Lack of wifi highlighted my over-reliance on the internet to solve problems in my code.  Re-evaluation of how internet/AI is used to solve minor poblems is advised.

- Continued practising CSS by replicating model websites.

- Productive but tiring day.
