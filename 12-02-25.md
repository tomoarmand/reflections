- Made a replica google search bar.  Some frustration trying to use AI for suggestions during this task.  Eventaully found it much simpler to trust instincts and forgo AI.

- Minor changes to github.io page.

- Went over CSS grid and input elements.

- Attended Sean's workshop on values, mindfulness and vulnerability.

- Good day overall.
